This dataset can contain songs of your choice, others collected from the web or any other combination. Some sources of songs can be:\n","\n","* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_songs)\n","* [Subset of million songs dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/#subset) *Note:* this dataset takes several GB of disk space!!!\n","* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify)\n","* Your favourite songs included in the Trello board as long as they are not hot songs :)\n","\n","## Considerations\n","\n","You want your dataset of not_hot_song to be:\n","\n","* As heterogeneous in terms of (genre, length,...etc) as possible to create better groups of songs.\n","* Not too big and not too small (typically around 2-3K) songs\n","\n","In a real-life scenario, you might want to have your dataset as biggest as possible and use specialized Big Data techniques like [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) to group similar songs together. However, you are going to work on your own laptop which has limited power. Therefore, you need to limit the size of your dataset of not_hot_songs otherwise the process of grouping similar songs will take forever.\n","\n","## Deliverables\n","\n","Your fork should contain a jupyter notebook with the code to:\n","\n","* Gather the songs\n","* Remove songs already present in the hot_songs dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align:
